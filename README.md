# ditherator
One image enters. Dithered images leave.

## Usage

There's a Windows file in [Releases](https://github.com/tommyettinger/ditherator/releases) (not the source code;
you want the `ditherator-windows-x64.zip` file). Download it, unzip it, and drag and drop an image onto the exe in the
File Explorer. The image can be a .jpg, .jpeg, or .png file. In usually less than a second, this will create a folder
next to the image, with the same name; e.g. if you drag and drop `Cat.jpg`, it will create a folder called `Cat`. In
that folder will be 8 or more dithered black-and-white images, all variations on the dragged image.

That's all there is to it for now. I might add in palette selection somehow, later, but the goal here was to make this
as simple and quick as possible to use.
